This repository holds the code to the webpage I have developed using HTML, CSS, bootstrap and some basic JavaScript for my client at Brumell Staffing. It is a simple website that features a home page, an about section, a job section through which you can apply for jobs and a contact section with contact form. This is an ongoing project and I plan to update and add functionality to the website as I learn more about my web development and acquire more skills.
